/**
 * This function simulates a fight between two fighters.
 * It takes two arguments: two `fighter` objects.
 * The `fighter` objects are expected to have `attack`, `defense`, and `health` properties.
 * The function returns a Promise that resolves with the winner of the fight (the fighter who still has health left).
 * The fight is simulated by listening for keydown and keyup events.
 * The fighters can attack, block, and use a critical hit combination.
 * The damage dealt by an attack is calculated using the `getDamage` function.
 * The damage dealt by a critical hit combination is twice the attacker's attack power.
 * A fighter can only use their critical hit combination if they haven't used it in the last 10 seconds.
 *
 * @param {Object} firstFighter - The first fighter object.
 * @param {Object} secondFighter - The second fighter object.
 * @returns {Promise} A promise that resolves with the winner of the fight.
